# Key Issues in Distributed Services and Transaction Management

- When business processes involve multiple service invocations, they often encounter challenges related to distributed
  transactions. These issues arise due to the need for consistency and coordination across different services.
- In core processes such as order management, payment, and accounting, data consistency, accuracy and reliability are
  critical. They play a crucial role in ensuring the stability and integrity of the overall system architecture.
- While distributed service architectures offer significant advantages, handling distributed transactions remains a
  major challenge. Many struggle with finding effective solutions, leading to uncertainty about whether to adopt a
  distributed architecture for high-reliability systems like payment platforms.
