# Key Issues in Distributed Services and Transaction Management

- When business processes involve multiple service invocations, they often encounter challenges related to distributed
  transactions. These issues arise due to the need for consistency and coordination across different services.
- In core processes such as order management, payment, and accounting, data consistency, accuracy and reliability are
  critical. They play a crucial role in ensuring the stability and integrity of the overall system architecture.
- While distributed service architectures offer significant advantages, handling distributed transactions remains a
  major challenge. Many struggle with finding effective solutions, leading to uncertainty about whether to adopt a
  distributed architecture for high-reliability systems like payment platforms.

## Challenges and Uncertainties in Resolving Distributed Transaction Issues

When handling distributed transaction issues, many people come across fundamental principles and strategies, such as  
**eventual consistency**, **compensation mechanisms**, **TCC(Tray-Confirm-Cancel)**, **Two-Phase Commit(2 PC)**, and  
**Reliable Message** && **Maximum Effort Notification**. However, the real challenge is understanding how to integrate
these methods, analyze business requirements, and strike a balance between business needs and the right approach to
solving real-world scenarios. Especially when it comes to choosing the best methodology for handling distributed
transactions, the key challenge is determining which the above approach works best for different business scenarios and
requirements.
