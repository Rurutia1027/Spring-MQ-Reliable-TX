# Transaction 
A transaction is a sequence of database operations that are executed as a single unit. It ensures **data integrity** and **consistency**, even in the case of system failures. 


## What's ACID ? 

ACID stands for four key properties of a transaction: 

- **Atomicity** - All operations in a transaction succeed or **none do**(all-or-nothing). 
- **Consistency** - The database remains in a **valid state** before and after the transaction. 
- **Isolation** - Transactions do not **interfere** with each other (no partial updates seen).
- **Durability** - Once committed, the transaction's changes are **permannent**, even if the system crashes. 


## Local Transactions 
A **local transaction** is managed within a single **Relational Database Management System**(RDBMS) or **Database Management System**(DBMS). 

#### Advantages of Local Transactions 
- **Strict ACID Compliance** - Local transactions strictly adhere to **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability**(ACID), ensuring **data integrity** and **reliability**. 
- **Efficient** & **Simple** -- Since transaction states are maintained **only within the DBMS**, the implementation is straightforward and highly efficient. 

#### Limitation of Local Transactions 
- **No Support for Distributed Transactions** - Local transactions are limited to **single database instance** and cannot handle **transactions across multiple databases or services**. 
- **Resource Manager Dependency** - The smallest **unit of isolation** is managed by the *resource manager**, restricting flexibility in multi-database environments. 
- **Process Boundaries** - A local transaction is confined **within a single process**, making it unsuitable for **distributed architectures** where multiple services interact with different databases. 
  

In summary, while **local transactions** are simple and reliable for **single-database operations**, they cannot maintain **ACID properties across multiple datasources**, making them unsuitable for **microservices and distributed systems**.
